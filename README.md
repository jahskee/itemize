# Language Detection App

## Video

## What does it do?
   The application detects information about the language 
   based on the entered string. Then it will display information
   in the message box. 

## Installation & Run

   yarn
   
   yarn start

## Notes

   * NODE_PATH was set to src/
   * I used api.js to separate concerns.

## Some Delays
   There is a delay in my coding, because I always setup redux.
   I realized, it is not needed because the application is simple.
